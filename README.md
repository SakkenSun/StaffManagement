# StaffManagement

This is a simple ASP.NET Core Project to work on Staff Management using MVC technology.
I will also have the demo video that I'll record and post to YouTube and add the link here:

To run this project we need to connect to the databse. I have include the database in the Database folder in the StaffDB file that you can import into Microsoft SQL Server. After you import you can connect to the database. 
After you connect to database you can now run the project from Microsoft Visual Studio.



When you run the project the first page will open the Index page that will show all data of Staffs. And more in that page you can edit, delete and also a dynamic page of each detail Staff, also you can create new staff too.
More in that page you can search Staff by ID, Fullname or by Gender. 

Moreover, I can export data as Excel file or Pdf File. It's done by using the Package call ClosedXML(For Excel Export) and iTextSharp (For Pdf Export)


As for Unit Testing, I have less experience in that field that I need more time to learn so that's all i can commit to this project with the require.
